### **1. Binary Search**
There are many test cases of array that contains checked number. The task is using binary tree algorithm to check if the check number is in the array. Print 1 if it is in the array or -1 if it is not in the array.
```
Input:
--> 1 test case
--> 5 6 the number of elements in the array and number to be checked
--> 6 5 8 7 3 the numbers in the array
Output:
--> 1 the result after check
```

### **2. String Search**
There are a pattern and a string that is contained in the pattern. The task is using string search algorithm to print out the times that the string appear in the pattern and what is its index in the pattern starting from 0.
````
Input:
--> abcdbcd the pattern
--> cd the string
Output:
--> 2 the appearance times
--> 2 5 the indexes that the string appear
```
